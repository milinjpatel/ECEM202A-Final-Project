## Abstract
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a popular wireless technology used in many consumer devices. It provides a low bandwidth, low power solution that allows devices to communicate with each other wirelessly and cheaply. Due to this, it has gained massive popularity among enthusiasts, as well as consumers. Time synchronization is the notion of different nodes in a system being aligned to the same reference of time. This allows for systems to provide timestamps for events that they see and correlating those timestamps across different nodes in an accurate way. Wirelessly time synchronizing nodes currently requires special hardware like 2.4GHz radios. From a consumer and enthusiast point of view, these technologies for time synchronization are not feasable. In order to provide a method for synchronizing time over BLE, we analyze software solutions. This solution would allow any system that supports BLE to be synchronized with any other system that also supports BLE completely through standard BLE hardware and open source software.
